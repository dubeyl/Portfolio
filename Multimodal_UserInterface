Please discover this project on creating a multimodal user interface for people with reduced motor abilities.
Our project revolved around creating something more than just a project for a course, but an application that could eventually be of use for some people.
With that goal in mind, we created a web-based Text editor that can be controlled solely with the gaze and the speech.
Thus it involves eye-tracking and speech recognition. If these topics interest you, do not hesitate to delve deeper into what we created.
